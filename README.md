Visit Irish Midlands gives information about places to visit in the Irish Midlands. 

## User Experience (UX) 
### Strategy

### Ideal user demographic
The ideal user of this website is:
* a resident of the counties of Laois, Offaly, Westmeath, or Longford;
* a visitor or potential visitor to those counties; 


### User stories
* As a resident, visitor, or potential visitor, I want to navigate easily through the website to find relevant information.

### Site owner
* As the site owner, I want to highlight local tourist attractions to the users.

### Scope
**What a user will expect**

* A website that is easy to navigate.
* Visually appealing regardless of screen size.
* Links and functions work as expected. 
* Information about attraction in the Irish Midlands.
* A way to contact the site owner.

**What a user may want** 
* To find links to social media pages.
* To see images of the locations.

**As a developer/ organisation I expect**

* To provide information about the town of Portarlington, its shops, and services.
* To provide an easy way for users to contact me.
* To provide a website that is easy to navigate and with links that work. 

<span style="text-transform:uppercase">Note</span> Not all of What the user may want will be implemented at this stage. 
Additional features may be implemented in due course. 
### Structure 
The site has three pages 
* Visit Irish Midlands
* Things to see
* Contact page

### Skeleton
When creating the website, I used responsive design. When the site is expanded from a mobile, stacked elements will display in two columns in each row, this means that more of the website can be seen at once. 

## pages
### Home page
This page has a large image of local scenery with an about section, then an explore section. It was planned to have a Google map below this but unfortunately, I have been unable to get this to work. I did get it working in jsfiddle.net but not when I transferred it to actual site. 

### Places to see
This page has three sections: 
* Forests & Woodlands
* Visitor Centres
* Historical sites

These three sections each have three information cards. 

### Contact 
A contact form is provided. I had hoped to get this to work as well, but I ran out of time. 

## Design
### Colour
The main highlight colour is "Purple". 

### Typography
#### Headings and menus
The heading font is [Gautreaux](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gautreaux) typeface. 


#### Body text and menus 
The [Warnock](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/warnock) typeface is used for body text. When choosing the font, particular care was taken to ensure that ≪Old Style≫ numbers were available.

### Continuity 
The page is designed to be user-friendly. The same templates are used on each page with similar headers and footers. This should make it easy and accessible for each user.
